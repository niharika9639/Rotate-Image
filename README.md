Introduction

This is a C++ program to rotate the input file (image) by the use of warpAffine function which is inbuilt in the OpenCV library. warpAffine takes 4 parameters. First is source image file, second is destination image file, third parameter is mat object that is output after rotating with some point taking into reference and last is taking the size. Rotating image by a given angle is a common image processing task. Although it seems little bit complicated, OpenCV provides some built-in functions making it easy to do it.
